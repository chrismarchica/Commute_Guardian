# This directory will contain GTFS-RT protobuf files
#
# In production, place GTFS-RT files here:
# - trip_updates.pb (from https://cdn.mbta.com/realtime/TripUpdates.pb)
# - vehicle_positions.pb (from https://cdn.mbta.com/realtime/VehiclePositions.pb)
#
# For development, the application will create placeholder files
# when the admin/replayFixtures endpoint is called
